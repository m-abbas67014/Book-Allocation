# Book-Allocation
This project implements the Book Allocation Problem using the Binary Search concept in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The goal is to allocate books among students such that the maximum number of pages assigned to any student is minimized. This is a common problem used to practice Binary Search on Answer and Greedy distribution logic.
